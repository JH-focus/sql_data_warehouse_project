# Data warehouse and analytics project

Welcome to my data warehouse project, where i will try to build a functional data warehouse based on a video tutorial.
This project is done with the purpose to initially build my skills, regarding data architecture and ETL-structure
to implement in future projects at work. 

I am currently in the position of project manager at a car dealership and want to evolve and focus my time on
programming - especially databases and APIs.

## Project requirements

### Building the data warehouse (data engineering)

### objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using postgreSQL to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and
informed strategic decision-making

### specifications
- data sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as csv-files
- data quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis
- integration: combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries
- scope: focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required
- documentation: provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and
  analytics teams

## BI: analytics & reporting (data analytics)

### objective
Develop SQL-base analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- customer behavior
- product performance
- sales trends

These insights are designed to equip stakeholders with business metrics, which enable strategic decision-making-processes

## License
This project is under MIT License - though very fundamental and probably improvable.
